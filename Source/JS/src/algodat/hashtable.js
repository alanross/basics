	 * In order to store key-value pairs in memory from our hash table we need a
	 * way to take the key and turn it into an address. We do this through an
	 * operation known as "hashing".
	 *
	 * Basically it takes a key and serializes it into a unique number for that
	 * key.
	 *
	 *    hashKey("abc") =>  96354
	 *    hashKey("xyz") => 119193
	 *
	 * You have to be careful though, if you had a really big key you don't want
	 * to match it to a memory address that does not exist.
	 *
	 * So the hashing algorithm needs to limit the size, which means that there
	 * are a limited number of addresses for an unlimited number of values.
	 *
	 * The result is that you can end up with collisions. Places where two keys
	 * get turned into the same address.
	 *
	 * Any real world hash table implementation would have to deal with this,
	 * however we are just going to glaze over it and pretend that doesn't happen.
